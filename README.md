## About project

In this project, we used the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) so that we can fetch and show the list of characters, the information of each character, and the episodes that each character has played through the endpoints provided by this API. Users can also add their favorite characters to the list of favorites. By default, the application displays the first 5 characters, but you can use the search section to find more characters. Also, a maximum of 6 episodes are displayed in the list of episodes of each character.

## Libraries used
